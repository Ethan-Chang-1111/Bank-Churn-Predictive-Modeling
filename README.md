# Bank-Churn-Predictive-Modeling
Final Project for FINA 4390-ML in Finance

This was my final project for FINA 4390, Machine Learning in Finance, at Northeastern University during my undergraduate. This was made and presented in conjunction with Marina Hopp, Lily Zhu, and QingruLiu. 

The goal was to predict if a customer will leave a banking service based on activity patterns. We developed multiple classification models to predict this behavior resulting in a model with a 0.91 F1 Score. These findings were presented to a panel of C-Suite executives in financial technology.
